# Vox Machina RPG Web App

A single-player RPG inspired by *Critical Role*, where you interact with Vox Machina and a Dungeon Master (DM) through immersive dialogue.

The frontend is a Vue/React web application that displays the conversation, player input, and DM responses in a chat-style interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Dialogue:** Player inputs text and receives responses from DM and party members.
- **Dynamic Chat Interface:** Automatically scrolls to new messages and shows DM “thinking” animations.
- **Immersive Roleplay:** Party members and DM maintain personality and tone from Critical Role.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile browsers.

**How it works:**

1. Player types input into the chat box.
2. Messages are displayed instantly in the dialogue.
3. DM responses appear line by line, optionally with a “thinking” animation.
4. Party member interactions and narratives are formatted for clarity.

> **Note:** Due to model being too large this frontend does not include a live backend.

### Getting the Model

This project requires the Vox Machina AI model, which is too large to include here.  

You can download it from [this separate repository / cloud link](https://example.com/model-download).
